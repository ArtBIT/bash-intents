# This intent file contains a list of REGEX rules to capture the "activation" intents.
# Intents like "turn on", "start", "enable", etc. are captured here.
# These regex rules also capture the action and the subject
# For example, "turn on the lights" will be captured as:
#  - action: turn on
#  - subject: lights
#  - intent: activate
